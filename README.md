The reason for this project was to let us practice the skills of HTML and CSS that we have learned since starting this unit. Thorughout the creation of this copycat website, it helped me to review many of the concepts that I have learned when starting this unit, such as inserting links and the box model for padding, border, and margin. This project also taught me that there can be different ways to address a single problem. If one way is less convenient in terms of organization, I could try to find another method to solve the same problem. Overall, this project has allowed me to strengthen my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
